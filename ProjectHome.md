PuzzleBazar is an open-source project for the development of a web-based system for puzzle amateurs built using the [GWTP model-view-presenter framework](http://code.google.com/p/gwt-platform/). The broad goal is not restricted to any specific type of puzzles, although the first version will focus on pencil & paper types of puzzles like Sudoku, Kakuro, Slitherlink and others.

The key features of the system are the following :
  * Extensible platform, making it easy to add new types of puzzles
  * Entirely runnable from a javascript-enabled browser (no flash, no plug-in)
  * Community-centered : open puzzle creation, group statistics, etc.
  * Support for learning tools and tutorials
  * Includes an embedded encyclopedia of puzzle genres
