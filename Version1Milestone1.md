# Introduction #

Port from [jspuzzle](http://code.google.com/p/jspuzzle). This newer version uses the suggested Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture, dependency-injection, UIBinder, localization, etc. The first step is to port most of jspuzzle to this new architecture.

Features that will be left out include tutorials, pages for puzzle browsing, and static welcome pages.
